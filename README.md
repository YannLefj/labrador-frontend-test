You have json file "data.json" in parameter. The goal of this exercices is to create a table from it, add stylization and add some functionalities on it.
First, create your own branch.
We need here one commit per exercise, to be able to see the progression of the development of the table.
Add the end, create a pull request.

First exercise : create a table from the json (in vanillaJs, not manually).

The table as to be well formatted (table, tbody, ...).
Each line of the table is a object from the json.
We need to have a first line in the table, as the head of the table, corresponding to the name of the attribute in the json (name, january, ...)

and 1 after "June" being the result of the whole semester
